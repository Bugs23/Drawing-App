# Drawing-App
This is a drawing app made to get more practice with javascript and jquery. Html and css were used for layout and styling.

Users can choose one of the three colors displayed by clicking them or click on New Color and make your own and add them to the lineup.

The erase button is not operating right now, Iâ€™m still working on it. Refresh to clear canvas.
